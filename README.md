Design Patterns Demonstration:
This repository contains implementations of various design patterns using Java. The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate an understanding of different design patterns through practical use cases.

Overview
The code in this repository is divided into two main exercises:

Design Patterns Demonstration:

1. Behavioral Design Patterns
Observer Pattern: A chat application where users receive notifications for new messages.
Strategy Pattern: A payment processing system with different payment methods.

2. Creational Design Patterns
Singleton Pattern: A configuration manager with a single instance.
Factory Pattern: A document editor that creates various types of documents.

4. Structural Design Patterns
Adapter Pattern: A media player supporting different formats using an adapter.
Decorator Pattern: A text editor allowing dynamic formatting options.


Astronaut Daily Schedule Organizer (Mini-Project)

A console-based application for managing astronaut daily schedules with CRUD operations, task validation, and conflict notifications.

Design Patterns Explanation:
  Observer Pattern: Allows objects to be notified of changes to another object without being tightly coupled.
  Strategy Pattern: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
  Singleton Pattern: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
  Factory Pattern: Creates objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.
  Adapter Pattern: Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
  Decorator Pattern: Adds behavior to objects dynamically without affecting the behavior of other objects.
  
Evaluation Criteria:
  Code Quality: Adherence to best practices, use of design patterns, SOLID principles, and OOP.
  Functionality: Correct implementation of design patterns and functionality.
  Error Handling: Graceful handling of all errors and edge cases.
  Performance: Optimized code.
  Explanation: Clear explanation of design decisions and logic.
  Documentation: Well-documented code and clear usage instructions.
